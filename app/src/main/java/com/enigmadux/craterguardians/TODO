todo PRIORITY:
    1) finalize Kaiser + Enemy1 attacks (mostly done)
    2) Create a new character +  New enemy + New enemy spawner  + for each character add an info button
    3) Make levels
        - make enemy1 less op, but spawn more frequenety
        - add the level buttons to the level select button (also add a home button)
    4) make the Level select layout neater, level buttons more random, use the textures array for the animations
    12/21-22: Heres the plan for level select, have a giant home button to the left (like now), then have a rounded rect frame
         to the right. In there it will be a scroll
         Toxic Lake Bublle animation
    12/23: Level select mostly done, work on getting levels I thnik 25 - 30 for first release is good enough
           start getting sound effects done: Tommorow get up to level 15 done. From level 12 and onwards maps should be bigger + more complex
           for tutorial make the times better,
           Completed: Levels 15, still have to fix tutorial
    12/24: GOALS: (first two are more long term:)
                  1) nerf attack rate/balance stuff in general
                  2) fix enemy's AI
                  3) Get up to level 20,(a little less is fine, lets target getting all levels done by end of the year = around 30 levels)
               levelIDEAS a level like the spider one (12 i think) but with like 6 arms, each with 1 hp spawner



    nerf attack rate, just balance stuff in general, fix enemy's AI

     FIRST UPDATE: add a character who has two nunchunks, resulting in  two circles
                    add personalized character attack noises

 Bugs:
 the level select layout sometimes is unresponsive to touches, also appears when it's not supposed too
 enemy's ai doesn't really work on level 2, when heading for hte supply
 pause button needs to be multi touch like evolve button, evolve button itself is hard to unselect
 shield in player doesnt compltely work
 Dont show the attack until power is a certain amount
 when messenger notification looks like it bugs out sometime
 when going to the navigation bar and going to the place where all apps are shown, app should only be paused, but the whole game restarts
 for tutorial if lost and press play again the "exit" sign goes away problem is because it makes the gamestate
todo:
 make animations, smoother transitions in general
  enemys ai plan: find all triangles and perform ray cast, if it intersects add a "stop" to the closest vertice, and recast
 TODAY: fix the bug where enemy's target position is somewhere it can't fit
todo:
    CODE + CONVENTIONS:
        finish javadoc
        group functions
        Make coordinates consistent (either center or bottom left)

todo:
    NON CODE:
    - for lobby music trim it, as there is blank at the end (lots of musics)
    - fix sound effects
    - fix the text so it looks nice (make it anti aliased)x
