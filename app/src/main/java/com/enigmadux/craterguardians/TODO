    TODO TODO TODO LONG TERM FIXES:


     FIRST UPDATE: add a character who has two nunchunks, resulting in  two circles
                   Possible procedural level, where it starts with strength 0, then 1, 2, 3 and a boss
                   Possible resource manager, apparently not good to load everything at the beginning
