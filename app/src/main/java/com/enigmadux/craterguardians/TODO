todo PRIORITY:
    1) finalize Kaiser + Enemy1 attacks (mostly done)
    2) Create a new character +  New enemy + New enemy spawner  + for each character add an info button
    3) Make levels
        - make enemy1 less op, but spawn more frequenety
        - add the level buttons to the level select button (also add a home button)
    4) make the Level select layout neater, level buttons more random, use the textures array for the animations
    12/21-22: Heres the plan for level select, have a giant home button to the left (like now), then have a rounded rect frame
         to the right. In there it will be a scroll
         Toxic Lake Bublle animation
    12/23: Level select mostly done, work on getting levels I thnik 25 - 30 for first release is good enough
           start getting sound effects done: Tommorow get up to level 15 done. From level 12 and onwards maps should be bigger + more complex
           for tutorial make the times better,
           Completed: Levels 15, still have to fix tutorial
    12/24: GOALS: (first two are more long term:)
                  1) nerf attack rate/balance stuff in general
                  2) fix enemy's AI
                  3) Get up to level 20,(a little less is fine, lets target getting all levels done by end of the year = around 30 levels)
    12/27 GOALS: finish crater image prototype, maybe 2 levels, enemy ai prototype (most likely using a* variant, with three different sizes 0.3 0.6 1)
        from level 25+ add a rainbow spawner this basically does a spawner like battle cats
    12/28,29 GOALS:
            1) Convert base characters + enemies to circles to save time Partially done need to optimize some stuff where it's treated as circular ellipse instead of just circle
            2) Find out why graphics are very memory inefficient + see the drawing FPS
            3) Finish enemymap + rest of enemy AI, thinking of only re calculate path when nearest target changes
            4) Draw basic icons that don't require a lot of art FINISHED
            5) Balance stuff (Also at some point fix the orientation of valley + do that in level maker as well)
            6) Fix pausing + stopping - tbd
    1/12 GOALS: Just try creating 1 really good level, make attacks less spammy, more skill
    1/21 GOALS: Start/finish evolving animation, hearts instead of progress bar
    1/23 GOALS: start/finish evolving animation (hopefully finish)
    1/25 GOALS: Find out what makes progress bars so slow, look into some optimizations, but mostly work on making UI better
                2) Making game environment good, I reccoemend obviously lowering Kaiser health, then make her attack more bullet
                like, and make enemies spawn less frequently
                3) For UI, for one fix the Buttons to not be parralelograms, rounded rects or smthing, then
    1/26 GOALS: Make the Button good Looking
        - I found that the app crashed once
    1/31 + FUTURE GOALS (unordered)
        1) Fix Character Select Layout (add info button, make it look nice)
        2) Fix UI as a whole
        3) Implement actual levels for players (as in it actually affects stuff)
        4) Balance players + enemy (CHANGE environement)
        5) Create more game levels, add node weights to game level files
        6) Artwork of spawners and such
        7) Sound effects (and music)
        8) Dynamic Text
        9) Optimize game, 60 fps always
        10) Make actual progress bars
        11) Enemy AI slightly buggy, might want to change a bit
        12) ADD MORE STUFF HERE
        priorities:
        dynamic text
        fix ui (first do positioning, worry about graphic part later)
        balance game environemnet
        optimization - look into instancing, also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4853856/why-are-draw-calls-expensive, explains that we shouldn't be drawing small amounts of quads
        player levels

    seee why the shaders aren't allowed in and out keywords, among other things

    OPTIMIZATIONS:
        1) don't focus too much on the matrix multiplication i don't think that's the bad part (small)
        2) Don't load textures during the game, mainly for progress bars, but perhaps just rework text in general use a Typeface instead
        3) Use as little synchronization as possible
        4) Where stuff are meant for ellipses, use circles (small)
        5) Avoid loading texture buffers during the game as well, instead use texture matrices (COMPLETE)
        6) May not work, but perhaps reduce the overhead by making a  way in textured rect to draw many at different positions
        7) For players, instead of using two textured rects for the evolves, use 1 textured rect with multiple textures (COMPLETE)

    THERES still more work on the AI, for example the actual level data needs to specify the width of the nodes, and weightage of connections,
    additionally, it seems that concurrent modification exception is happening sometimes

    THE CAUSE OF THE LAG IS THE PROGRESS BAR, MAKE A DYNAMIC TEXT CLASS + STATIC TEXT CLASS
    FULLY IMPLEMENT WAVES

    ANOTHER BUG: on level 19 it looks like first wave targets player initially?

    Make a level where there is many enemy twos on the side
    Make Home screen a separate class
    Rework character select to make it mor e like battle cats, I think we make it a 2d array of icons, if you click on it
        three options appear, upgrade, select, info

    sometimes it seems that health bars/ evolve button randomly goes to the center of the screen

    Upgradable characters - mostly done
    Implement Waves - mostly done

    make zooming further out and longer so user has more time to prepare

    nerf attack rate, just balance stuff in general, fix enemy's AI, possibly something like a*

     FIRST UPDATE: add a character who has two nunchunks, resulting in  two circles
                    add personalized character attack noises


     OPTIMIZATION: graphis are taking a lottttt of memory fix this, pausing is bad/ fix these

 Bugs:
 the level select layout sometimes is unresponsive to touches, also appears when it's not supposed too
 enemy's ai doesn't really work on level 2, when heading for hte supply
 pause button needs to be multi touch like evolve button, evolve button itself is hard to unselect
 shield in player doesnt compltely work
 Dont show the attack until power is a certain amount
 when messenger notification looks like it bugs out sometime
 when going to the navigation bar and going to the place where all apps are shown, app should only be paused, but the whole game restarts
 for tutorial if lost and press play again the "exit" sign goes away problem is because it makes the gamestate
todo:
 make animations, smoother transitions in general
  enemys ai plan: find all triangles and perform ray cast, if it intersects add a "stop" to the closest vertice, and recast
 TODAY: fix the bug where enemy's target position is somewhere it can't fit
todo:
    CODE + CONVENTIONS:
        finish javadoc
        group functions
        Make coordinates consistent (either center or bottom left)

todo:
    NON CODE:
    - for lobby music trim it, as there is blank at the end (lots of musics)
    - fix sound effects
    - fix the text so it looks nice (make it anti aliased)x
