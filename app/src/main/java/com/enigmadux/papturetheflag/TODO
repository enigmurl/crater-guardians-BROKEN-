 Bugs: Find out why the joysticks are kind of choppy, and make it a circle, rather than an oval
 make the loading of spawner textures smoother, also textures for enemies and attacks, overall its just bad. Most likely make it static
 Sometimes crashes due to null pointer(mainly for plateaus?), seems like going slowly solves it?? For now I just put a conditional in the draw of Plateau, but i need further solution
 fix the game environment scaling
 For stuff that have isTextureLoaded() that derive from textured REct, delete the sub classes method
