Have a hitbox, that can be movable or immovable,

every frame:
    Create a Graph of intersections:
        for each link:
            if any are immovable:
                treat all neighbouring stuff as max(state,semi immovable)
            if any semi immovable has two or more immovables:
                take the average of the clips, and now it's fully immovable

            for each neighbouring component:
                if both are immovable: continue;
                if (one is immovable, other is semi immovable):
                   clip semi immovable (keep a copy Node, that replaces this original one)



            for each neighboring component:
                if already handled: continue;
                if (


    each time something wants to move:
        clip it with plateaus

    each time enemy wants to move:
        clip it with shield

    Shields can only push, spawns out like a cone
